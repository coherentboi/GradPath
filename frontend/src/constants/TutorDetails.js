        about: "Hello! My name is Justin Oh, and I am an IB student entering grade 12 with an average of 95% in my top six subjects, including Higher-Level Math. I have a keen interest in mathematics and frequently participate in math competitions. I've been honored with invitations to compete in elite contests like the AIME and to attend prestigious workshops such as the Auckland Workshop. This summer, I was thrilled to be invited by Johns Hopkins University to join their accelerated Engineering program, where I have delved into advanced physics and engineering concepts. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring engineering further, and I am currently working on a project that leverages machine learning to optimize traffic flow.",
